- My Perfect Writing 20/05/2025

The portal My Perfect Writing is under development for complete redesign. Therefore, I have started to write test automation scripts along as the modules are developed.
- What I have done so far is:
-   Prepared environment for the automation, described as follows:
-     Playwright with javascript(typescript)
-     Github for version control
-     Github Actions for CI/CD (May be transitioned to Jenkins in near future)
-
